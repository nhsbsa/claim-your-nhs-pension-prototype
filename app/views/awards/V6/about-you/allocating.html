    <div class="panel panel-border-narrow">

    <p>  Allocation is where you permanently give up part of your pension now to your spouse, civil partner or a dependant. If you die, the allocated person will receive this amount as a pension.</p>

  <p>  If you allocate to anyone other than a spouse or civil partner, they must be dependant on you at the time of your retirement and when you die.</p>

  <p>  If you allocate, it will provide an additional payment on top of any adult dependant's pension or children’s pension that may be payable.</p>

  <p>  To apply, you’ll have to pay for a medical. We can send you guidance on this.</p>

<div class="panel panel-border-narrow">

  <p>
    You can nominate someone to receive an adult dependant's pension and lump sum on death benefit if you die.
  </p>

  <p>
This does not affect the amount of pension you receive.
